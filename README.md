# Synked

Synked is an experimental project to see if the principles of DDD, real time sync and reactivity can be combined
together to create a highly secure coding paradigm.

The project consists of various modules which can be used individually or collectively together to craft beautiful software. 
The vision is to make something generic that can work across projects and domains. This is also a weekend project and as such
does not have a high priority in being executed. 

This project is built using NX

## List of core packages

### Model
Model is used to define Domain data models that also contain reactivity in them. The idea is to have the models work across
both web clients, mobile clients and server applications. 

### uid
UID is used to generate unique identifiers that can be used in distributed systems.
